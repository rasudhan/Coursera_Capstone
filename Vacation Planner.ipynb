    "Planning a trip to a destination with as many choices as Los Angeles can be intimidating. Planning is not easy. Especially when it involves traveling to unknown places. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many websites and guidebooks you could wade through, that the amount of information is overwhelming. So I've tried to take some of the stress out of the process by organizing the best planning resources for you all in one place. This Los Angeles Vacation Planner will help guide you through the decisions you will need to make to maximize your Los Angeles vacation, whether you are traveling on a tight budget, or looking for a luxury getaway.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will try to outline optimal travel plans for a city. Specifically, this report will be targeted to travellers interested in finding **popular spots** to visit during their trip to **Los Angeles**, California.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are lots of scenic places and spots to visit in Los Angeles, we will try to pick **venues that are most popular in Los Angeles based on Foursquare data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use our data science powers to **generate an itinerary** based on this criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interest\n",
    "This will be of interest to travellers who have never been to Los Angeles and who would like to make the best use of their time. We will help maximize their vacation with this itinerary, filled with a wide variety of attractions, activities, and dining options that will truly showcase the best of L.A.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will help travelers to plan their travel itinerary. The algorithm should be able to provide an **optimal itinerary recommendation** in terms of *distance* and *popular spots* in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be extended to any place of interest(city/country). The user can provide a desired place of interest and we will generate a travel plan for them based on popular venues in and around the place of interest."
